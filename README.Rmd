###Description: Tidy table for Activity Recognition Experiment Using Smartphone Sensors data.

**The script "run_analysis.R" can be run from R or RStudio command prompt. The raw data can be downloaded from here: [download the data from this link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Upload the follwoing raw data in the working directory.**

```
* activity_labels.......*Links the class labels with their activity name*  
* features..............*List of all features*  
* subject_test..........*volunteers - there are 30 *  
* y_test................*activity - there are 6 types*    
* X_test................*Test dataset*  
* subject_train.........*volunteers - there are 30 *  
* y_train...............*Activity - there are 6 types*  
* X_train...............*Test data set*

**The accelerometer produces data in units of acceleration (distance over time2), and the gyroscope produces data in units of rotational velocity (rotation distance over time) measures rotation around three axes: x, y, and z.**

**The following six activities were observed for  30 volunteer's who had participated in this excersise.**

  *Activity types*
```
* 1 WALKING
* 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4 SITTING
* 5 STANDING
* 6 LAYING
```
**These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.**

```
* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag
```
**The set of variables that are included in this data set are: **
```
* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
```
