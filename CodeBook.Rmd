### 1. Background and Overview
The ‘human activity recognition experiment using smartphone embedded sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometer was carried out to identify the type of activity the owner of a smartphone may be engaged in based on the data emitted from the sensors. 30 Volunteers were chosen and were asked to walk on even ground, walk up the stairs, walk down the stairs, seat, stand and lay down. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the experimenters captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) attached to their waist. The accelerometer produces data in units of acceleration (distance over time2), and the gyroscope produces data in units of rotational velocity (rotation distance over time) measures rotation around three axes: x, y, and z. The captured data was randomly partitioned in two sets. The first dataset, where 70% of the volunteers data collection was labeled training(train), and the second set, the remaining 30%, was labeled testing(test). 

The objective is to clean the untidy raw data, and generate a data set that conforms to the *'tidy'* data rule.

###3.  Activity type and volunteer numbering description

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers *(labeled 1 to 30)**. Each row identifies the volunteer who performed each of the six activity. The activities are labled as follows:

   No. | Activity           
 ------|---------------------
   1   | walking 
   2   | walking_upstairs 
   3   | walking_downstairs
   4   | sitting
   5   | standing
   6   | laying


### 4. Data combination and preparation 
When downloading the data the data comes ziped. the first action is to unzip the file.  Since the different files contain different part of the same observation and had a raw variable name, the next step is to provide a recognizable variable name and to assemble the files into a single table.  We start with changing the variable names for volunteers - and activity, and get the default for the rest of the column names (the rest of the column names are modified in the later steps.)

Start combinding the data with the test-X/train-X, test-y/train-y, test_subject/train_subject datasets using the ‘rbind’ function.  Use the feature file as a variable name for the combined dataset using the ‘colname’ function.  The next step is to put all the data sets together in one lump. The dplyr  bind_cols function was used to get one big lump dataset. 

_Here are the commands used:_
```javascript
X_test_train <- rbind(X_test, X_train)
y_test_train <- rbind(y_test, y_train)
subject_test_train <- rbind(subject_test, subject_train)
colnames(X_test_train) <- features$V2 
df1 <- dplyr::bind_cols(subject_test_train, y_test_train, X_test_train) 
```
The combination of this data frame results in 563 columns and 10,299 rows.  Convert the data frame to data table to apply data table packages.

Next, the **activity_labels** dataset contain the six activities for this experiment in assigned number and description. 1. walking 2. walking-upstairs etc. The ‘match’ function was used to replace the activity label from number to descriptive in the combined dataset. 

_Her is the command that was used:_
```javascript
df12$activity <- with(actLvl, V2[match(df12$activity, V1)]) 
```
The duplicate function was used to  check and remove duplicate columns. 

_Here is the command that was used:_
```javascript
duplicated(colnames(df12)) #Verify duplicate column existence - False is none True is yes
df12NoneDup <- df12[,!duplicated(colnames(df12))]#remove the duplicated columns
```

### 5. Variable summarization and inclusion
The dataset contain data measurement signals that were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each patterns.  'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. However for this data table it was requested to capture **all of the “mean” and “standard deviation” for all measurements, including Frequency and angle.** 

Before extracting the files, the table was grouped by volunteer and activity.  For that we used a deployer package group_by function.  Since there were many obersravtions of the same activity per volunteer, the plyr package summarise_each function was used to distill all observations to single observation taking the average of all the observations. 

_Here is the command used:_
```javascript
df12Mean <- df12NoneDup  %>% group_by(volunteer, activity)  %>%  summarise_each(funs(mean))
```
Because the assignment calls for “Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. “ The following command is used to extract all columns with variable name that includes ‘mean’ or ‘std’.


_Here is the command that was used:_
```javascript
ActvRecgnData <- select(df12Mean, volunteer, activity, matches(".mean."), matches(".std."))
```

This results in a data table that is 180 rows and 88 columns. 

```
_> dim(ActvRecgnData)_
**[1] 180  88**

**The size of the fils  0.14MB**
_> object.size(ActvRecgnData)_
_140800 bytes_
```

The final tidy data is **_ActvRecgndata_**. And it can be saved as a csv file and shared.
```javascript
write.csv(ActvReconData, file = "ActivityRecogni-fnl.csv") #the final "tidy data" saved...
```


Here are the variable names. (look at section 6 for detail of variable naming convention)

## 6. Variable naming convention
The column name element abbreviation are created by using the first letter of the element used from the features data. Here is an example of column name abbreviation reading:

```
                Feature Variable                Acronym Variable
                
example 1: fBodyAccMag-meanFreq                 fBAMmF
example 2: tBodyAccJerkMag-std                  tBAJMs
example 3: angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)          atBAMg

```
